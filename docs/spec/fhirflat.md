# FHIRFlat specification

The FHIRflat structure closely follows that of FHIR, and simply flattens nested
columns in a manner similar to `pd.json_normalize()`. Some fields are excluded
either because they are simply used for convenience within a FHIR server,
because they contain information not relevant within ISARIC clinical data, or
because they would contain Personally identifiable information (PII). These
fields can be accessed and edited for each resource using the `flat_exclusions`
property. There are a few specifics to FHIRflat that differ from simply
normalising a FHIR structure, noted below.

1. **codeableConcepts**

   CodeableConcepts are converted into 2 lists, one of codes and one of the
   corresponding text. The coding is compressed into a single string with the
   format `system|code`. The ‘|’ symbol was chosen as it is the standard way to
   query codes in FHIR servers
   [(example)](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#3.2.1.5.5.1.3). Thus a JSON
   snippet containing a codebleConcept:
    ```json
        "code": {
            "coding": [
                [
                    {
                        "system": "http://loinc.org",
                        "code": "3141-9",
                        "display": "Body weight Measured",
                    },
                    {
                        "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
                        "code": "27113001",
                        "display": "Body weight",
                    },
                ]
            ]
        }
    ```
    is coded as two fields
    | code.code                                                        | code.text                               |
    |------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
    | ["http://loinc.org\|3141-9", "http://snomed.info/sct\|27113001"] | ["Body weight Measured", "Body weight"] |

    Note that the external `coding` label is removed.

2. **References**

    Reference are a string with the name of the resource with the ID, separated by a forward slash.
    ```json
    "subject": {
        "reference": "Patient/f001",
        "display": "Donald Duck"
    }
    ```
    becomes 
    | subject.reference |
    |-------------------|
    |"Patient/f001"     |

    The display text will not be converted due to the risk of revealing identifying information (e.g., a patient's name).

3. **Extensions**

    The base FHIR schema can be extended to meet the needs of individual implementations using extension fields. FHIRflat displays these with the extension `url` as part of the column name. For example

    ```json
    "extension": [
        {
            "url": "timingPhase",
            "valueCodeableConcept": {
                "coding": [
                    {
                        "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
                        "code": 278307001,
                        "display": "on admission",
                    }
                ]
            },
        },
        {
            "url": "relativePeriod",
            "extension": [
                {"url": "relativeStart", "valueInteger": 2},
                {"url": "relativeEnd", "valueInteger": 5},
            ],
        },
    ]
    ```
    becomes
    | extension.timingPhase.code          | extension.timingPhase.text | extension.relativePeriod.relativeStart | extension.relativePeriod.relativeEnd |
    |-------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
    | "http://snomed.info/sct\|278307001" | "on admission"             | 2                                      | 5                                    |

    Complex (nested) extensions such as relativePeriod also omit the internal `extension` labels.


3. **0..\* cardinality fields**

    Fields which can contain an unspecified number of duplicate entries are dealt with according to the number of entries present. lists of length == 1 are expanded out as above, while any longer lists are kept in a single column with the data in it's original nested structure and `_dense` appended to the end of the field name. These fields are not expected to be queried regularly in standard analyses.

    For example, the `diagnosis` field of the [Encounter](https://hl7.org/fhir/encounter.html) resource has 0..* cardinality. If a single diagnosis is present, the field is expanded out:
    ```json
    "diagnosis": [
        {
            "condition": [{"reference": {"reference": "Condition/stroke"}}],
            "use": [
                {
                    "coding": [
                        {
                            "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/diagnosis-role",
                            "code": "AD",
                            "display": "Admission diagnosis",
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ],
        }
    ]
    ```
    becomes
    | diagnosis.condition.reference | diagnosis.use.code                                         | diagnosis.use.text  |
    |-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
    | Condition/stroke              | "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/diagnosis-role\|AD" | Admission diagnosis |

    whereas if 2 different diagnoses are present
    ```json
    "diagnosis": [
        {
            "condition": [{"reference": {"reference": "Condition/stroke"}}],
            "use": [
                {
                    "coding": [
                        {
                            "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/diagnosis-role",
                            "code": "AD",
                            "display": "Admission diagnosis",
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ],
        },
        {
            "condition": [{"reference": {"reference": "Condition/f201"}}],
            "use": [
                {
                    "coding": [
                        {
                            "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/diagnosis-role",
                            "code": "DD",
                            "display": "Discharge diagnosis",
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ],
        },
    ]
    ```
    becomes 
    | encounter.diagnosis_dense            |
    |--------------------------------------|
    |"[{"condition": [{"reference"...}]}]" |
