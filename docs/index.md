# fhirflat -- flat file structure library for FHIR resources

fhirflat is a library for transforming FHIR resources in NDJSON or native Python dictionaries to a flat structure that can be written to a Parquet file.

fhirflat is a **prototype library**, subject to **major revisions** that is used for the [ISARIC](https://isaric.org) 3.0 project and data pipelines. Portions of the code are specific to the ISARIC project, such as ISARIC specific FHIR extensions.
